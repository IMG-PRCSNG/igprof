IgProf is non-intrusive profiling application for GNU/Linux systems,
complementary to other tools such as valgrind's callgrind, oprofile,
and compiler built-in profiling support.

The code is regularly tested and used on RedHat Enterprise Linux
systems, mainly RHEL4 and RHEL5 at the moment, but we do try to
make sure the code works on other systems as well. The profiler
has been used extensively on ia32. Support for x64 is still very
much experimental. Some support for Mac OS X PPC remains in the
code but it is unknown if it still works.

In order to build the package, please do something like this:

 - On ia32 systems:

     tar zxf classlib-3.0.9.tar.gz
     tar zxf igprof-5.7.0.tar.gz

     cd classlib-3.0.9
     ./configure && make -j 4 install
     cd ..

     cd igprof-5.7.0
     cmake . && make -j 4 install

 - On x64 systems:

     tar zxf libatomic_ops-7.2alpha4.tar.gz
     tar zxf libunwind-0.99.tar.gz
     tar zxf classlib-3.0.9.tar.gz
     tar zxf igprof-5.7.0.tar.gz

     cd libatomic_ops-7.2alpha4
     ./configure && make -j 4 install
     cd ..

     cd libunwind-0.99
     ./configure && make -j 4 install
     cd ..

     cd classlib-3.0.9
     ./configure && make -j 4 install
     cd ..

     cd igprof-5.7.0
     cmake . && make -j 4 install
