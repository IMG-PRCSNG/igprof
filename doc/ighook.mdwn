IgHook is a dynamic instrumentation library written by Lassi Tuura.  It
provides functionality to tap into any routine in an existing programme or
library, and to maintain records: capturing stack traces, efficiently keeping
track of which functions were called and how often, or keeping tabs on
resources allocated and released to find leaks.

IgHook currently works on Linux (IA32 and, mostly, X86_64) and Mac OS X (PPC).
It is used by IgProf profiling tools and was used to implement TraceOnThrow
debugging utility in COBRA: ability to dump a stack trace whenever an exception
is thrown anywhere in the application.
