### Profile software

To profile you just prefix the command line with `igprof` and options of your
choice.  The profile outputs from long runs can be large so it's advisable to
compress the data.  You would run the performance profiler with compressed
output like this:

    (time igprof -d -t cmsRun -pp -z -o igprof.myrun.gz
     cmsRun myrun.cfg) >& out.myrun.txt </dev/null &

If you'd like to run the memory profiler instead:

    (time igprof -d -t cmsRun -mp -z -o igprof.myrun.gz \
     cmsRun myrun.cfg) >& out.myrun.txt </dev/null &

Or perhaps both at the same time?

    (time igprof -d -t cmsRun -pp -mp -z -o igprof.myrun.gz \
     cmsRun myrun.cfg) >& out.myrun.txt </dev/null &

The above commands send the job output and the final profile to files in the
current directory.  The `-pp` option enables the performance profiler and the
`-mp` option the memory profiler.  The `-d` option adds a little more
information about the workings of the profiler itself, mainly to the very
beginning and end of the job.  It helps to see the profiler is active and
working correctly.

The `-o` option sets the name for the profile output file.  If you don't give a
name, then a file `igprof.NNNNN` will be created, where `NNNNN` is the process
id.  The `-z` option tells igprof to compress the profile output file using
gzip.  The `-t` option constraints which processes can be profiled, which is
useful in case the process launches subprocesses.  In the above examples we
restrict the profiling to `cmsRun`; by default igprof would profile all
processes.

### Analyse results

Once you've run the profiler, you can analyse the results like this:

    igprof-analyse -d -g -v igprof.* | less

The `igprof-analyse` command produces the actual profile statistics for the
run, or mulitple runs if you give it several statistics files.  The output can
be quite large so you'll generally want to read it using a pager such as `less`
or save it in a file.  You can also produce the output in HTML format and look
at it with your web browser.

Enjoy!
