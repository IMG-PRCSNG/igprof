IgProf was developed by Lassi Tuura, Giulio Eulisse (both from [Northeastern
University][neu] and then [FNAL][]), Mikko Kurkela and Filip Nyb√§ck ([Aalto
University][aalto]) in order to assist software development projects for the
[CMS experiment][cms] at [CERN][]. Filip [thesis is available from
his personal web page][filip-thesis].

A number of people have contributed valuable feedback and help with the project
planning over the years, in particular Vincenzo Innocente, Lucas Taylor, Peter
Elmer.

The authors can be reached at [igprof-developers@googlegroups.com][igprof-developers].

The development was funded by the United States [National Science
Foundation][nsf] and [Department of Energy][doe]. Additional features have also
been funded through Google Summer of Code (GSoC 2014).
